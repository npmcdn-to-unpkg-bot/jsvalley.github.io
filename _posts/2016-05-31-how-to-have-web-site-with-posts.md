On the previous post, we learned how to have a website with very basic setup
This time, we want you to have many posts without maintaining list of index table.
These are the steps
<!--more-->

1. Create `_posts` directory
2. Create your articles within `_posts` directory
3. Link your articles on your index page

Again, Let's get into the detail.

### 1. Create `_posts` directory

### 2. Create your articles within `_posts` directory
At this time, you may say
"I want to have different look-and-feel for articles only".

It's as simples as
 1. create one more file in your `_layouts` directory
 2. change `layout: default` to your own in your article files.

An important thing is that you need to have date as `yyyy-mm-dd` as
the prefix of your article.

For example, 2016-06-10-my-article.md

Another important thing to remind is to add [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/)
into your article.

### 3. Link your articles on your index page

Now update your index.md to show all posts.
